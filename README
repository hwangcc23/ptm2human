ptm2human: ptm trace to human-readable format
=============================================

[About]:
ptm2human is a decoder for trace data output by Program Trace Macrocells 
(PTM) [1] as specified by the ARM's Program Flow Trace architecture document [2].
It deconstructs ID packets and data packets from the formatter of ARM Coresight ETB [3],
and then translates the trace data to a human-readable format. 

[Usage]:
1. Save the PTM trace stream into a file.
2. Give the trace file to ptm2human:
        $ ptm2human -i /path/to/trace/file -c 4
   The result is printed to the stdout. Redirect it to a output file:
        $ ptm2human -i /path/to/trace/file -c 4 1> /path/to/output/file
3. Read traces in a human-readable format:
        $ more output.log
